## 4. Preliminary Usability Problems Identified

Based on initial inspection, the following issues require detailed evaluation:

### Problem Areas to Investigate:

1. **Visibility of System Status**
   - Unclear what actions are available to non-logged-in users
   - No indication of multi-step processes

2. **User Control & Freedom**
   - Uncertain if users can easily navigate back or cancel actions
   - Unclear error recovery mechanisms

3. **Consistency & Standards**
   - Mixed presentation styles
   - Unclear adherence to web conventions

4. **Error Prevention**
   - Form validation and guidance unclear from homepage
   - No visible help or support resources

5. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**
   - Heavy text requires users to remember information
   - Limited visual cues or icons

6. **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**
   - Excessive text on landing page
   - Cluttered information presentation

## 6. Research Questions

To guide the evaluation process:

1. How easily can first-time users understand what services are available?
2. Can users quickly identify how to register or log in?
3. Is the payment process clear and trustworthy?
4. How well does the interface support common land management tasks?
5. Are error messages helpful and recovery options clear?
6. Does the interface work well on mobile devices?
7. Is the interface accessible to users with disabilities?
8. How does the interface compare to similar government portals?

## 7. Initial Design Hypotheses

Based on preliminary observations, potential improvements may include:

- **Task-oriented homepage:** Focus on "What do you want to do?" rather than organizational information
- **Visual hierarchy:** Clear distinction between primary actions (Register, Login, Pay) and secondary content
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show relevant information at the right time rather than all at once
- **Visual design refresh:** Modern, clean interface with appropriate spacing and typography
- **Mobile-first approach:** Ensure functionality across all devices
- **Clear navigation:** Intuitive menu structure with breadcrumbs and way-finding
- **Trust indicators:** Security badges, help resources, and clear process explanations

## Conclusion

The Malawi LIMS portal presents an excellent opportunity for HCI redesign. As a critical government service, improving its usability would have tangible benefits for Malawian citizens and land professionals. The interface shows multiple areas for improvement across information architecture, visual design, navigation, and accessibility.

Next week's heuristic evaluation will provide detailed, evidence-based documentation of specific usability problems, which will inform the redesign process.
